jquery.attribute-watch.js - jQuery Attribute Watch Plugin
------------------------------------------------

Using this small plugin you can observe any DOM element attribute and/or its CSS properties. Yes, we definitely need to use [Mutation Observers](http://updates.html5rocks.com/2012/02/Detect-DOM-changes-with-Mutation-Observers), but current situation with its implementation in scope of Internet Explorer causes the  solutions like this plugin

Initial idea and implementation inspired by [Darcy Clarke plugin approach](http://darcyclarke.me/development/detect-attribute-changes-with-jquery/)

##Requirements
jQuery 1.* (it is always recommended to use the latest version of jQuery)

##Desktop Browser Support
TBD
